        <h3 class="STYLE6">
            <a name="1" id="1"></a>Overview </h3>
        <p class="STYLE6"> In recently years, data science technologies, such as big data, AI and machine learning, have attracted increasing attention in various networking domains, from network applications to network infrastructure, from telecom networks to enterprise
            networks, from service providers to equipment manufactures. This trend is enabled by advances and applications of big data technologies in communication networks, and increasing bodies of networked data have become available to be analyzed
            and mined. Therefore, there is an urgent demand of tools and products of exploiting this data to provide more intelligence in network operations and management. We see largely three bodies of networked data to be explored: </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li> Telecom data. Operation logs of network elements, telecom data, especially data from cellular networks provide a wide variety of subscriber activity logs ranging from social activities such as calls and messaging, mobile payments, to multimedia
                streaming and gaming, with or without geographical information. The massive amount of telecom data offers network operators a unique opportunity to gain a more comprehensive picture of the network operation as well as their customers.
            </li>
            <li> Enterprise network data. Data from machines connected to an enterprise network can be exploited to improve security, IT ops, and business analysis for the enterprise. </li>
            <li> IoT data. The advances in IoT technologies have opened up new playgrounds for data science. Many new data science applications are proposed and deployed to optimize and improve the performance of such networks and the applications on top.
            </li>

        </ul>

        The workshop aims to bringing together researchers, data scientists, data analysts, and engineers in the area of networking to exchange their ideas, experience, and results in all aspects of mining networking data and injecting intelligence into networks
        and networking equipment.

                <img src="image/ZihuiGe.png" width="160" style="float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 8px;margin-top: 8px;">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> There is a recent boom on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) driven by significant advances in Deep Learning technologies and applications. It has become a common belief that in the years
                to come artificial intelligence can replace human intelligence in performing many types of tasks, including some highly complicated ones such as communication network management. On the other hand, technology advances in software defined
                networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) are transforming how networked services are managed and operated, driving toward a highly efficient, even a “zero-touch”, network operation model. In this talk, I will discuss
                how ML/AI fit in the vision of “zero-touch” network operations, particularly on control loop automation, a mechanism that facilitates fault management, performance management, service and resource optimization functions in network operations.
                I will focus on the challenges and opportunities both in enabling smooth operation adoption of ML/AI capabilities and in creating ML/AI based solutions for operational problems.

            <p><strong>Dr.Mark Crovella, Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science, Boston University, USA</strong></p>

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> The talk is mainly about analysis of data from computer networks. Every person is unique and complex. But can we predict anything about how large groups of people will behave? In the 1960s the science fiction
                writer Isaac Asimov imagined a field called “Psychohistory” that could mathematically describe the actions of large groups. I will argue that in a certain way, aspects of that vision are in wide use today. To illustrate, I will describe
                examples from my own work in which the “low dimensionality” of aggregate human behavior gives us leverage on a range of problems, from predicting network traffic to detecting anomalous or malicious behavior in social networks.

                and is the author of over two hundred papers on networking and computer systems. He holds ten patents deriving from his research. Between 2007 and 2009 he was Chair of ACM SIGCOMM. He is a past editor for Computer Communication Review,
                IEEE-ACM Transactions on Networking, Computer Networks and IEEE Transactions on Computers. He was the Program Chair for the 2003 ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference and for IFIP Networking 2010, and the General Chair of the 2005
                Passive and Active Measurement Workshop. His paper (with Azer Bestavros) “Self-Similarity in World Wide Web Traffic: Evidence and Possible Causes” received the 2010 ACM SIGMETRICS Test of Time Award, and his paper (with Gonca Gursun, Natali
                Ruchansky, and Evimaria Terzi) “Routing State Distance: A Path-Based Metric for Network Analysis” won a 2013 IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize. Professor Crovella is a Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> As we become increasingly reliant on a variety of large-scale Internet services for our daily activities, providing as good a quality-of-experience (QoE) as possible to users become imperative. For example, even
                a small increase in response time hurts user experience and impacts the monetization ability of service providers. It is thus extremely important for service providers to understand the key factors that impact performance and to quickly
                detect and diagnose any performance degradation. However, this is an extremely challenging task, as cloud computing and large-scale Internet services such as search engine and online video streaming services have necessitated a complex
                architecture of centralized data centers and distributed edge servers dispersed across a web of interconnected access and backbone networks to provide speedy response times to users. There are a gamut of diverse, interacting factors that
                can influence and affect users' QoE, spanning servers in data centers, CDN edge servers, various networks on the paths, client machines and user agents (e.g., web browser) and user behavior.<br> Clearly, it is important to collect various
                sources of data from system configurations, performance metrics and dynamic network usage and leverage "big" data analytics to tackle this challenge. In this talk, we argue that it is important to develop a systematic framework to guide
                this process in order to cope with the vast complexity of network performance monitoring and trouble-shooting, where domain knowledge plays a crucial role. In particular, we will describe a framework based on statistical inference and
                machine learning techniques to first identity and quantify the major categories of factors that have major influences on system performance. We will use two real-world case studies to illustrate the utility of this framework: i) understanding
                the complexity of 3G UMTS cellular network performance; and ii) dissecting the search response time variations of a large web search engine as well as a comparative study of the impact of architectural design choices on the performance
                of two large web search engine services.
